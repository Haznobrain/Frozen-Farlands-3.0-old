ff-01-3 = Hello, I am your main core AI. We survived, but the fight is not over. \nPlease follow my next intructions.
ff-01-4 = Use [#7aff83]poly[] units, they will help you mine and build. \n Take them and mine whatever lays here, fast.
ff-01-5 = Mine [#969ea3]yttrium[]
ff-01-6 = Our Serpulo tech is not efficient here due to low temperature. \nopen \ue875 [accent]tech tree[], research [#969ea3]micro drills and conveyors.
ff-01-7 = Okay, almost there, look at [#969ea3]pin[] turrets, they will be our base defence.
ff-01-8 = Research and place 2 [#969ea3]pin[] turrets.
ff-01-9 = Listen, this is definitely not a safe place, especially if parts of our shooted down cores are falling from the sky.
ff-01-10 = To reinforce the core we will need ice shards, but they need \ue810 electricity to function. \nResearch [#fa9134]ATG generator[] and put some [#fa9134]arcanite[] in it.
ff-01-11 = Now place [#95c4e6]ice crushers[] facing the glacier and upgrade the core.
ff-01-12 = Something is not right.. enemy presence here is ridiculously low, but I guess its better for us.

ff-04-5 = [red]I have done a quick analysis of their base. \n[accent] Using combined assaults of different air and ground units will be needed to destroy their production and then core.
ff-04-6 = [red] TRANSMISSION RECEIVED FROM NEARBY SECTOR.
ff-04-7 = [blue]How'd you- dang you serpulo units really did evolve to be quicker at war. \n Mocking you for your lack of technological advance due to constant infighting was maybe not a good thing...

sector.moon-mod-Solar-peaks.description = One of 2 main bases of Bushark on Zilo, their technology far surpasses yours but there is no turning back now, eradicate everything and steal their technology.
sector.moon-mod-Solar-peaks.details = A base built on a stategical place, Bushark is here mainly because of the terrain. Bushark thinks that it is impossible to approach it from any side but you found a small ravine and made your way through it.

sector.moon-mod-Frontline.name = Frontline
sector.moon-mod-Frontline.description = We are preparing for our final target, main base of Bushark on Zilo, also known as The Fortress, they already know our plans and they are throwing everything at us, if you will be able to defend yourself, we can launch an attack on The Fortress.
sector.moon-mod-Fortress.name = The Fortress
sector.moon-mod-Fortress.description = The greatest base that Bushark has ever built. Many attacks were already launched here, none of which were successful. They have an unimaginably powerful super weapon guarding their main entrance, this base is extremly guarded. The more time you spend defending, the harder it gets. Your base will be constantly attacked, you have to launch succesful counter attacks in order to survive. If you manage to capture this base, the whole of Zilo will be under our control.
sector.moon-mod-Fortress.details = The first and strongest base of Bushark, at first it was planned to only be a research facility. Upon stumbeling on the fragmental technology and realizing it's potential, they decided to keep researching it. After years they had invented first weapons such as the Defragmentation but this was not enough. They had found a way to trigger a chain reaction beetwen atoms affected by fragmental split which at first seemed impossible. Then they had created this superweapon, Restart was the only project that used this new fragmental technology, it is almost a technological miracle, we would never be able to research it. But Bushark are inventors, they love new tech. Unfortunately, once you have destroyed everything here, we will not get new information but at least we will have an entire planet for ourselves.
